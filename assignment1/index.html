    <h2 class="b">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="c">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
      <li class="c">
        CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or
        in othe media.
      </li>
      <li class="c">
        <span id="a1">CSS is not necessary</span>
        <span id="a2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can contol the layout of
        multiple web pages all at once.
      </li>
      <li class="d">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="b">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="e">
        Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1
      </li>
      <li class="e">Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
      <li class="e">
        External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file.
      </li>
      <li class="e">
        The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. how ever,
        <span id="a3"
          >in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span
        >because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="f">
      When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one
      unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </p>
    <p class="f">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of
      styles can be applied to the elements.
    </p>
    <p class="f">
      There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used
      are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should
      be applied.
